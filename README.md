<h3>The future is now.</h3>

Every pool needs an excellent user interface in order to attract users and maintain an excellent reputation.
Although other frontends do exist, many of these were hastily created with generic templates and aren't entirely open source projects.
That's where we comes in.
Fourcore is a frontend designed for all pools that use the miningcore backend.

<h3>What's our mission?</h3>

Fourcore strives to follow these four principles, hence the four in our name:
1. Stay open-source for all eternity.
2. Continue maintaining and improving the code.
3. Expand to support other pool software such as NOMP.
4. Focus on designing a better frontend for all pools.

<h3>Dependenices</h3>
This website can be used on any server that supports HTML, CSS, and Javascript such as standard Apache and Nginx web servers.

<h3>Configurations</h3>
In order to properly configure the pool, enter assets/js/fourcore.js and look to lines 1-5.
First, change the API variable to point towards the pool (example.com/api/).
Then, change the current variable to its proper value.
This  is used to locate the proper statistics for the proper coin if the pool is used for multiple coins.

<h3>Issues and Contributing</h3>
If you find a specific issue within the documentation or code, feel free to open an issue clearly explaining the occurance or create a pull request for our team to look over.
We accept all efforts that one might contribute towards this open-source and thank those users.
